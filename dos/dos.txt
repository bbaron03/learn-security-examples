- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

The vulnerability is that the server uses the user input directly without sanitization. Therefore, 
the user can submit an input that is invalid, which would in turn crash the server. Then,
the user can spam this request as they wish in order to continue to keep the server down. The secure
version wraps the request in a try catch statement, which prevents the program from crashing once receiving
an illegal input. Another security mechanisms we should implement is to sanitize the user input before its use in a query.
There should also be some rate limiting middleware that would prevent a dos attack from occuring
