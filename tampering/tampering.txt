The input from the user is not being sanitized, so malicious code could be executed by the program. 
When name is substituted in the html being sent to the client, the name could be a javascript or html snippet 
that can executed instead of a string. This attack is cross-site scripting attack. The secure version 
sanitizes the input, thus removing the possibility of the code snippet executing unexpectedly. It violates integrity 
since we are altering input to perform unsanctioned actions.
