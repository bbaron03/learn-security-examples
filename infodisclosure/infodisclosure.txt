Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
Which CIA property does tampering violate?
What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate?

The system is vulnerable to NOSQL injection in our insecure.js file. The system does not sanitize
the input from the user request to the "/userinfo" endpoint. The secure version prevents the vulnerability
because it sanitizes the input username given from the user in the request. It violates confidentiality because
the data can be accessed incorrectly through NOSQL injection.
