- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version is better at preventing repudiation than the insecure version.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

The vulnerability in the insecure version comes from the fact that there are no logs being taken
to check where each request comes from. Additionally, the inputs to the form could come from any user,
which means that there is no way to tell what user actually submitted the form. The secure version
logs each request coming in using middleware and logs the incoming ip address. This gives the server the 
ability to determine who sent any given request. Duplicating the logs across several log files would be one example 
of an additional security mechanism to incorporate.
